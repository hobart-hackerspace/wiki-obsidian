# Some basic Obsidian settings for editing the HHS Wiki
There are many settings in Obsidian, especially when taking the plug-ins into account. The images below are the settings used as the site was initially created. They aren’t locked in stone, but please be careful when changing them as many will replicate via `git` to other folks’ copies of the site.

### Publishing
- Set to allow spread across window

# Community plug-ins

1. PlantUML
	- This was tried - It works perfectly when locally run with Obsidian but isn’t Publish-compatible
	- So we need to find an alternative approach for these.
	- This is required in order to include UML diagrams in our documentation.
	- One example of its use is the documentation of the [door controller sequences](Door%20system%20sequences.md)
