# Power Points at 2 St Johns Ave
The building seems to have been rewired not long before we took occupancy. The circuit breaker board is in the old entrance foyer. Lights and GPOs are RCD-protected. There is a single 63A RCD for all GPOs and another 10A for all the lights.

Most of the GPOs are on their own circuit and many of them are 4-outlet. All GPO circuit breakers are 20A.

All GPO breakers are labelled with a ***B*** suffix. 
That relates to the Neutral bars - there are ***A*** & ***B*** bars identified on the breaker board.
