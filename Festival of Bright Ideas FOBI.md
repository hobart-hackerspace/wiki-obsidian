# Background information:
(*Notes from Alistair post the 2024 FOBI*)

FOBI is a 2 day science event normally held at the end of research week
each year at PW1. HHS has been involved for a number of years ( \~6 as
at 2024 I think). 

Bump in is Thursday afternoon and bump out is Saturday afternoon, at
which time vehicles are allowed to drive in to PW1 to drop off pick up
items.

# Registration:

Calls for registration normally come out in May/June. We do get emails,
but you can register manually on
their website <https://festivalofbrightideas.com.au/> ( which is used
each year to provide info )

A briefing is conducted about two weeks out ( via Zoom) to go over the
event\'s arrangements.

# HHS actions required.

1.  Initially it is important to have a plan for the theme of the
    activities we\'d like to present. This must be entered in the
    registration process and needs to be well-developed as it is used on
    the website and print media to attract the public to the event and
    to our activity.
    - Request the space you want to occupy. We normally ask for a
    space with about 4 tables across the front and 2 at the back and
    this works fairly well.
2.  Start canvasing early for people to support the event. It can be
    hard to get people to \"lock in\" 2 months early but the more it is
    socialised the better as more people will keep it in mind as the
    date gets closer.
3.  Plan and develop the activities that support the theme you have
    decided upon. The earlier you start on this, the better the result
    will be, noting that everyone is busy. 
    1.  Ask people to take on tasks and check in with them to make sure
    they are progressing
    2.  Have a backup plan just in case.
    3.  Request a budget from the committee, the HHS has funds and this
    is one of the biggest membership drives we do each year so a
    budget of up to \$500 is not unreasonable in most circumstances,
    more if your theme has a particular requirement or you need to
    outsource the TAG and TESTING. 
4.  Develop a plan and ( contingency ) for how the equipment is to be
    bumped in and out of PW1.
    1.  We have so far been fortunate each time we have run this
    activity to have had Tom, Ken, and others provide the use of a
    Ute and or larger car to move the equipment
    2.  A Ute and/or large car is a much better option than a trailer,
    as turning around inside PW1 is much easier.

5.  As the event gets close, start gathering the required equipment in
    the space and test it to make sure it is working as expected

6.  TAG and TEST all electrical equipment. FOBI has a requirement for
    all devices to be current for TAG and TEST but I have not seen them
    actually inspect for this at the event.
    - Shane, Tom and others have been able to support this requirement
    in house but we have also outsourced this in the past as well (
    ensure that a budget is allocated for this if needed)

7.  Draw up a roster and distribute names, times and contact information
    to volunteers ( remember not all people will be on Facebook)
    - Plan to have at least 3 people on at any time as this allows for
    breaks without leaving the stand unattended

8.  On bump-in day ( Thursday) meet at the space to gather and load the
    equipment and go to PW1 to setup. 
    - This process normally takes about 1-2 hours, depending on the
    theme.

9.  On the two days of the activity, plan to arrive early (8 am) and
    make sure the display is all working as required
    - FOBI often puts on an optional \'thankyou event\' on Friday
    night.

10. Bump out occurs immediately after the public departs the activity
    (typically 4:30 pm)
    1.  Pack up and move all gear back to the space.
    2.  it can be roughly sorted back into the space with most of the
    equipment being put away properly over the next week or so.
