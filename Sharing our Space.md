## A checklist for sharing our Space

We share our Space with other members. That gives us the benefit of shared tools and shared ideas. But it also gives each of us responsibilities.

Some of those responsibilities are in our [Terms of Use](https://hobarthackerspace.org.au/terms_of_use/), which you have to agree with to join with us.

Others are more general, but are summed up by:

### Safety
- **Your safety is *your* responsibility**, as is the safety of those around you.
- **Don't use a tool without induction and/or training**. Even if you've used a similar tool elsewhere -- there may be quirks with this one.
- **Use suitable PPE (Portable Protective Equipment**. If we don't supply it, bring your own or report the lack.
- **Report accidents and near misses**. If we don't know it happened we can't stop it again. Incident forms are by the back door.

### Security
- **Keep the external doors closed** when it's not a public open time, otherwise folks can just walk in off the street. This isn't a vague threat - we have had stuff stolen, both personal items and Hackerspace stuff.
- **Keep the container door closed** unless you're actually working in it -- it's particularly visible and accessible from the street.
- **Swipe your RFID tag every time** you visit the Space (even public nights) -- it gives us statistics that we can use to demonstrate the extent of our use of the place and also gives us records of who was here when, should the need arise for some reason.
- **When you leave**, note [the departure checklist](Building%20departure%20checklist.md) by the back door. In particular, ensure the place is locked up and the chain is across the gate if the place is vacant when you leave.

### Consideration of others
- **Put portable tools back** in the place where you found them, so that someone else can find them too. If you find a tool somewhere odd and know its correct home, return it when you're done.
- **Check and/or recharge batteries** for portable tools when you finish with them for the day.
- **Don't leave unfinished jobs** or unused materials in or on fixed tools like CNC, laser cutter, 3D printers etc. It blocks others from using the tool. When you're done, clean the tool up for the next person.
	- **If you leave it, you've given it to everyone else.** Part-finished jobs and part-used material left in a work area are available to all to use. If you absolutely must leave something unfinished, leave a note with your name, phone no or email and the time and date. 24hrs is the longest you can leave stuff.
- **Keep the kitchen sink clear** of dirty stuff and put clean stuff away. It's a health hazard to others to leave food or dirty plates around.
- **Keep the toilet, sink & basin clean**. *If you mess it, clean it!* No-one likes cleaning up someone elses's messes. The detergents, toilet cleaner and cleaning implements are for everyone's use, not just for the cleaning person.
