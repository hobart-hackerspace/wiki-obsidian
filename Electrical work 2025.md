# Electrical work needed Dec 2025
For room locations see separate diagram.

1.	Heater in Ada Lovelace room
	- Switchboard circuit breaker \#1A (currently taped out)
	- 3.5kW wall-mounted unit in NW corner of room)
	- Thermostat switch knob is broken
	- Needs a more accessible switch
	- Would be great if we could operate remotely
	- Suggestions
		- Replace thermostat and/or knob so the unit is back to operational status
		- Add separate wall-mounted switch above the heater
		- Include with separate switch a 20A wifi-connected "smart" relay (Brian has one spare if needed)

2. Heater in Bertrand Russell room
	- Switchboard circuit breaker \#2A
	- Currently a wired-in wall-mounted 2kW heater
	- Convert to plug-in and replace wall connection with GPO, so that we can add a plug-in smart switch 

3. GPO for communications equipment 
	- Switchboard circuit breaker \#10B
	- Currently a quad GPO with another double GPO in parallel in Comms cabinet
	- Disconnect second dounle GPO
	- Replace quad GPO with 15A double GPO
		- If a 2x15A GPO is not allowable, a single would be acceptable.
