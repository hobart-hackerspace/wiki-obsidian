[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a personal note-making tool that is free, stores its information locally and runs on all major platforms (Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS and Windows).  You can use Obsidian for free for yourself. It’s also free to use to contribute to our wiki, although you do have to register as a user. We use an additional  paid licence of the *Obsidian Publish* product to generate and host our  wiki pages,

Obsidian stores all its text information in [Markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax) format. This is an extremely readable plain text format that makes documentation easy. The Obsidian markdown editor is especially easy to use. 

## The repository
All markdown source and assets (images etc) are stored in and shared from a [GitHub](https://github.com/hobart-hackerspace/wiki-obsidian) repository. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is used to manage the content and to publish web pages to this site. 
The GitHub repository is public, so anyone can read from it or clone it. 

If you’d like to change or add something, if you don’t already have a *GitHub* account, you need to set that up.
- Go to [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) and follow the prompts.

When you have an account there are several ways to contribute:
- You can use standard GitHub processes: 
	- Raise an issue in [the GitHub *Issues* log](https://github.com/hobart-hackerspace/wiki-obsidian/issues) to report an issue or 
	- Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/hobart-hackerspace/wiki-obsidian/pulls) with the proposed change.
- Alternatively, for active members the easiest thing is simply to make the change yourself, [using *Obsidian* and a `git` tool](Contributing%20using%20Obsidian%20and%20Git.md).

## Maintainer
The base system is maintained by [Brian Marriott](mailto:brian.marriott@hobarthackerspace.org.au) -- 
but it's up to all members to provide the content!
