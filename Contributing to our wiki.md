[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a personal note-making tool that is free, stores its information locally and runs on all major platforms (Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS and Windows).  You can use Obsidian for free for yourself. It’s also free to use to contribute to our wiki, although you do have to register as a user. We use an additional  paid licence of the *Obsidian Publish* product to generate and host our  wiki pages,

Obsidian stores all its text information in [Markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax) format. This is an extremely readable plain text format that makes documentation easy. The Obsidian markdown editor is especially easy to use. 

## The repository
All markdown source and assets (images etc) is stored in and shared from a [GitHub](https://github.com/hobart-hackerspace/wiki-obsidian) repository. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is used to manage the content and to publish web pages to this site. 

The GitHub repository is private, to protect our shared intellectual property. All members are entitled to have access — just ask a committee member if you’d like access. You can also use [the GitHub *Issues* log](https://github.com/hobart-hackerspace/wiki-obsidian/issues) to report problems or suggest changes.
