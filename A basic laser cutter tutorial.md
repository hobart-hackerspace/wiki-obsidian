# A simple example job to show the basics of our BeamBox
Whether or not you've not used a laser cutter before, this will show you the basic setup of our BeamBox Pro™.

## Background
For full details including startup information, read [Laser Cutter Basics](Laser%20Cutter%20Basics.md), as far as the section entitled [A tutorial](Laser%20Cutter%20Basics.md#A%20tutorial) (referring to this page).

**Always** be aware of [basic laser cutter safety](Laser%20Cutter%20Safety.md).

# Tutorial
## Workfile
**You'll need something to do**

For this tutorial, we provide [an example workfile](https://hobarthackerspace.org.au/assets/wiki-assets/lasercutter_example.svg) for you to try.
It's small enough that you can use it on something from our scraps collection - 
a random piece of acrylic or MDF, at least 90x55 mm in size and 3mm thick. 

Download it and store it somewhere suitable on the computer that you're using. Ignore the horrible colours - you'll see their purpose shortly.

(**More to come...**)
