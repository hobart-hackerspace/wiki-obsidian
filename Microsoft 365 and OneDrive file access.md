title: Access to the Hackerspace's Document store
---

# Summary

The Hackerspace has a subscription to Microsoft's [Microsoft 365 (aka
Office365)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365) service. It is
currently provided free by Microsoft. It provides us with the email system that we
use for Hackerspace governance and gives a document store for us to store and
edit Microsoft Office files such as Word documents and Excel
spreadsheets. We can also store non-Office documents (such as PDFs) but
the system doesn't provide for these to be edited on-line. 
These documents provide us with our
long-term organisational archive, independent of changes in membership
of the Committee and the Executive. All Committee members have access to this 
document store.

The document store is accessed via the Microsoft OneDrive and SharePoint
systems. This is a guide to logging in to access, add, remove or change
items in the document store.

Editor's notes:

1. This is a slight edit of a document originally written for a different
	organisation. I've not changed the images so some of the details on the 
    screenshots are wrong for us.
1. The original target audience was lower in technical competence than HHS
	members, so just skip over the low-level stuff...

## Notes on terminology
*SharePoint* and *OneDrive* are two different names for ways to get to
the document store. They have slightly different "user experiences", but both
provide access to the same underlying set of documents. For simplicity,
this document will focus on just one of those pathways: *OneDrive*.

Similarly, *Microsoft 365* was previously known as *Office365*, so you
may see reference to either term.

For brevity and consistency, this document refers to a "Microsoft
account" that you connect to with a user-ID and password and
"OneDrive" as the document store to which you then have access.

# Logging in
1.  For any of this to work, you need to have access to your Hobart Hackerspace
    Microsoft account details. Your user name will be something
    of the form: `firstname.familyname@hobarthackerspace.org.au`. 
    If you don't know your username and password, send an email to
    <webmaster@hobarthackerspace.org.au> and request the details. You
    will receive an email reply containing a username and a link to
    click on to connect to the system. A password will be provided
    separately. When you first connect, you will be asked to set a
    password that you know and can remember.
2.  You may have Microsoft 365 accounts for other purposes than the
    Hobart Hackerspace. These can be both a personal account and other
    organisational accounts such as work, school or other volunteer
    organisations. As noted above, they may be called "Microsoft 365"
    or "Office365". If you have any such accounts, the next few points
    are essential:
    a.  Multiple Microsoft accounts can cause confusion in use. You need
        to remain aware of which account you are using at any point in
        time.
    b.  If you (or others who use your computer) have multiple accounts,
        you can tell which account you are using by clicking on your
        user icon (the little round icon in the top right-and corner of
        your browser window that has in it your initials in it or your
        personal photo, if you've created one).
    c.  You can switch between such accounts simply by clicking on the
        user icon and selecting a different account.
3.  To log in, open your favourite web browser and go to: 
    [office.com](https://office.com/)
4.  At this point, if you are not signed into any Microsoft account with
    that web browser, it will offer you a way of signing in. If,
    however, you are already signed into another account, it will open a
    page into that account (see 6 below).
5.  There are many forms of the pages asking you to sign in, depending
    on previous usage on your computer. But they have key things in
    common:
    a.  There may be a button that says "Sign in", without any
        associated email address. If so, click it.
    b.  It will ask you for your email address or it may offer you one
        or a list of ones it knows about. Either way, it wants your
        Hobart Hackerspace email address, as mentioned in section 1
        above. Ensure that the correct one is there, or type it in where
        it says "Email , phone, or Skype", then click "Next" or "Sign
        in".
    c.  It will require your password. If you've logged in recently
        using this computer and web browser, it may already know that
        and present you with a line of dots. Otherwise, type in (or
        paste in) your password. Press "Next".
6.  If it immediately opens a page into another Office365/Microsoft365
    account that you are subscribed to, don't fuss, just click on your
    personal user icon in the top RH corner and select "Log in with a
    different account".
    a.  It will then ask you to choose from a list of addresses by which
        it knows you or to "Use another account".
    b.  If your Hackerspace account is listed, click on it, otherwise select
        "Use another account" and proceed to enter your Hackerspace address
        and password as in 5 above.
7.  If this is your first time logging in, you'll be asked to change
    your password (to something that you know and that you can both
    remember and keep secret). You'll also be asked to provide
    alternative contact details in case you forget your password. This
    will come under the heading of "Your organisation needs more
    details to be secure" or similar wording.
8.  Once you've successfully logged in, you should be presented with a
    screen that looks something like this:\
    ![](/img/MS365_Home_page_on_first_login_-_Committee_member-psq5npqobwqe7w5dmduoe2w5ygi4.png)
9.  You can select Microsoft 365 applications from the bar down the
    right-hand side or from the "channel nine" icon in the top right.
    The bar on the right won't always be there, but the "channel nine
    icon" seems always to be present (albeit in different colours).
10. The two most useful apps are:
    a.  Outlook (for Hackerspace-related email and events) and
    b.  OneDrive (for document storage and sharing).\
        You may need to open the App selector ("channel nine") to see
        the OneDrive icon
11. If you don't have Word or Excel installed, the online versions of
    those are available, too, but with less functionality than the
    installed versions. See the note below if you wish to use another
    Office-like application or application suite

# Access to documents

The Hackerspace's document store is best viewed using the OneDrive
application within Microsoft 365. They are also accessible from other
Microsoft 365 applications, but OneDrive provides a file-and-folder view
that is nearest to that which you're used to using with Windows (or
MacOS).

Once you're logged in to Microsoft 365, you can use the OneDrive
application by clicking on the OneDrive icon as shown in item 5 above.
That will normally take you to a screen that looks like this (the actual
files listed will be different):\
![](/img/OneDrive_Home_page_-_Committee_member-ue3qmgjf5jcf432olc2jrob53zgr.png)

The first time that you log in the display above will be slightly
different -- it may not have anything below the "Quick Access" heading.
If this is the case, to get to the Committee files, here's what to do:

-   Under "Quick Access" in the left-hand margin, click on "More
    places\..."
-   Then click on "Go to SharePoint Home"
-   Under "Featured links" in the left-hand margin, click on
    "Committee Documents"
-   Open any one of the documents that are accessible from the
    "Committee" page

Then, next time you go to OneDrive, you'll have "Committee" showing
under "Quick Access".

Within the "Committee" folder, there are sub-folders for various aspects
of Hackerspace governance, including things like Meetings, Membership, and our
Publications. Feel free to explore.

## Replication of OneDrive documents onto your local computer
It's always possible to download OneDrive documents to your computer, 
edit them there and re-upload them. But this doesn't preserve the document history
(who edited it when) nor provide for reversion to earlier versions. Both these
capabilities are provided when you edit documents on-line.

You can get those capabilities, however by installing the *Microsoft OneDrive* application.
This provides a locally-stored copy of the documents, while also providing almost-instant 
replication and change tracking of files. It even shows when someone else is editing the same
document and where they are editing it.

*Microsoft OneDrive* runs on Windows machines and (slightly less-reliably) on MacOS. 
It's not available for Linux machines. A comparable ability is provided on pads and phones
with a *Microsoft OneDrive* app. In all cases, download it from your app store.

# Committee document format

The normal formats for our documents for internal use are Microsoft Word
and Microsoft Excel. For distribution to members we convert them to PDF,
so that there is no requirement for members to have copies of Word or
Excel.

Clicking on a Word or Excel document on a OneDrive or SharePoint web
page will open it within your web browser in a web version of Microsoft
Word or Excel. These versions are functional but clumsy in some ways and
limited in others.

If you have Microsoft Office installed on the computer from which you
are viewing the OneDrive pages, you can choose to open the documents in
the application on your machine instead of in the web browser.

To do this, either: 

-   click on the group of three dots in a vertical line that shows up
    when you hover over the document's title on the page,
    -   choose "Open" then "Open in app" from the little side menu
        that shows.
-   or click the document title to open it in the browser, then
    -   Close to the top of the page that opens, there's a button
        labelled "Editing ∨"
    -   if you click on that, it will offer you the option: "Open in
        Desktop App"

In either case, once you've opened it on your local machine you will
see, in the very top bar of the open document, an "AutoSave"
slider-switch icon. If you leave that turned on, all changes to the
document will automatically be saved back to the OneDrive store as you
make them, so others can see them at the same time. This is a great
feature in meetings where several may be viewing and sharing
simultaneously.

Turn it off if you want to create a different document by using the first
one as a base.

## Use of alternate applications

Some folks prefer to use non-Microsoft applications for text and
spreadsheet documents. If you choose to do so, that is your choice, but
our experience with folks doing that in the past leads to some caveats
that you will have to live with:

-   Recognise that many people don't even understand that there ARE
    different word processor & spreadsheet applications.
    -   So the use of the native formats of those applications can be
        extremely confusing.
-   Whatever format you use on your own machine, please place documents
    for sharing on the OneDrive in Microsoft Office format. Any of the
     alternative "Office" suites offer the option to save in a
    Microsoft-compatible format.
-   Saving in Microsoft Office format enables both:
    -   automatic opening on a single click and
    -   dynamic tracking of changes being made by another user.
-   The latter is particularly important when documents are being shared
    during meetings.
