## Our password vault

Credentials for access to many of our systems and service providers are stored in a single password vault.

The vault is provided by [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com), an open source service which provides both web access and a downloadable app that runs without network connection (and syncs to the cloud service as and when it can). 

We use the free "personal" flavour of the service, with a single set of credentials shared amongst trusted members. If you need access to it, ask a committee member. 

If you do use it, it's strongly suggested that you [install the app](https://bitwarden.com/download/) on to at least one of your devices - it will run on most modern platforms (Win, Mac, linux, iOS & Android) and can even run from the command line if that's your bent. You can use it for your own secrets, too - just set up your own set of credentials and log into whichever you need at the time.
