The Hackerspace has a number of channels to provide and share information.
Some are private to members, while some are open to the world. 
All members are encouraged to participate in and contribute to these (although you may have to ask for write access:-).

# Websites
We have two websites:
- a promotional website — [hobarthackerspace.org.au](https://hobarthackerspace.org.au) and 
- our wiki — [wiki.hobarthackerspace.org.au](https://wiki.hobarthackerspace.org.au).

## [`hobarthackerspace.org.au`](https://hobarthackerspace.org.au)
This is our most public site, with details of our activities, location and membership. It includes a contact form for folks to make specific enquiries. All such enquiries are forwarded by email to our cmmittee.

This site is hosted by GitHub Docs and is built from markdown pages using the [Jekyll static site-building tool](https://jekyllrb.com/). All content is saved in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hobarthackerspace/hobarthackerspace.github.io) and is published when commits are made to that repo.

## [`wiki.hobarthackerspace.org.au`](https://wiki.hobarthackerspace.org.au)
This is our site for members to share information about the Space and their activities. 
While targeted specifically to members, it is open to the world to view.

We specifically ask members who are building or managing tools, events or systems for the Space to use this wiki to record what they have created. We have an unfortunate history of things being left undocumented when folks move on, leaving others to re-learn or even re-build.

Any member can [contribute to this wiki](Contributing%20to%20our%20wiki.md).

# Social media
## Facebook
We have a very active [Facebook messenger chat group](https://www.facebook.com/messages/t/6102847819802361) and a low activity [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HobartHackerspaceMembers).
## Discord
We have a [*Discord*](https://discord.com/) channel: [`hobarthackerspace`](https://discord.com/channels/584145652196442115/882117828264726558). Access requires an invitation — just ask a committee member ([yellow badge](Hackerspace%20Wiki.md#Member%20identification)).

# Technical information
- We have a [GitHub “organization”](https://github.com/hobart-hackerspace) with multiple repositories where we share designs and code. Some repositories in this are public; some are shared only with invited members.
	- Store references to individual repositories in [the wiki](https://wiki.hobarthackerspace.org.au/), so that other members can easily find out about them.
- [This wiki](https://wiki.hobarthackerspace.org.au/) is a shared space to store information on configuration and location of shared systems.

# Governance information
The Hackerspace is an incorporated not-for-profit association. As such, we are obliged to keep and make available records of members, meetings, cashflows, etc.
- Committee members have access to a Microsoft365 cloud storage service where we hold copies of all committee-related documents.
- Committee members also have an email group for formal committee communications. This is part of the Microsoft 365 service.
Whilst some of this information is necessarily confidential, if there’s something you’d like to know, ask a committee member ([yellow badge](Hackerspace%20Wiki.md#Member%20identification)).
