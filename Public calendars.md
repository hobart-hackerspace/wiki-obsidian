Our public calendars are available on the [public website website](https://hobarthackerspace.org.au/events/calendar/).  It shows two calendars -- **Events** and **Resources**.

If an activity involves a group of us, whether or not it’s at the Space, we put it in the Events calendar.

If an activity at the Space will need exclusive use of a room or a major tool, we put it in the Resources calendar.

Committee members can add or edit these.

## Editing or creating a booking
