# Hobart Hackerspace wiki ([wiki.local](#home))

This is our documentation store. This is **your** place to stash records of how to use our gear and what projects/experiments you've done.

In the spirit of our *Make -- Learn -- Inspire* motto, use it to:

- **learn** from others' experience, 
- share how you **made** something (including the gory details *and* the mistakes) 
- **inspire** others to explore and create!

Connect from within our local network at: [wiki.local](#home) (`http` only — `https` isn’t possible in`.local` hostnames). From outside, it's [http://wiki.hobarthackerspace.org.au:7008/](http://wiki.hobarthackerspace.org.au:7008/) or 
[https://publish.obsidian.md/hhs-wiki/Hackerspace+Wiki](https://publish.obsidian.md/hhs-wiki/Hackerspace+Wiki).

You will be required log in. This is a small barrier to help retain our intellectual property. The password is the same as that for our in-house wifi connections.

We encourage all members to contribute to our wiki and correct any errors. The tool we use to maintain the site is [*Obsidian*](https://obsidian.md) — a free, multiplatform Markdown editor. [Click here for more details.](Contributing%20to%20our%20wiki.md).

# Our Building
Our home is a shared space and [a heritage building](Gatehouses.md). Please respect these when using it.
The heritage issue means that we have to be careful how we look after the building, especially the older stone parts.

# This wiki
Our wiki is based on [*Obsidian*](https://obsidian.md) software. The content is created and maintained in *Obsidian* and then published to the web. *Obsidian* is a file-based personal note-making system, using Markdown -- a markup language you're probably already familiar with (or can learn very quickly if you're not). 

Details on how to add to or change it are in the [How to use this wiki](Contributing%20using%20git%20on%20a%20laptop%20or%20desktop.md) page. 
Briefly, all source is in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) format; it is stored in and shared from a [github](https://github.com/hobart-hackerspace/wiki-obsidian) repository. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is used to manage the content and to publish to this site.

The base system is maintained by [Brian Marriott](mailto:brian.marriott@hobarthackerspace.org.au) -- 
but it's up to all members to provide the content! The [details of how to do this are here](Contributing%20to%20our%20wiki.md)

If you have suggestions for improvement, 
[email Brian](mailto:brian.marriott@hobarthackerspace.org.au) or add an issue to [our  Github tickets page](https://github.com/hobart-hackerspace/wiki-obsidian/issues).
