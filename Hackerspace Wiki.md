# Hobart Hackerspace wiki ([wiki.local](#home))

This is our documentation store. This is **your** place to stash records of how to use our gear and what projects/experiments  you've done. (We trust you not to stuff it up or misuse it.) 

In the spirit of our *Make -- Learn -- Inspire* motto, use it to:

- **learn** from others' experience, 
- share how you **made** something (including the gory details *and* the mistakes) 
- **inspire** others to explore and create!

Connect from within our local network at: [wiki.local](#home). From outside, it's [wiki.hobarthackerspace.org.au:7008](http://wiki.hobarthackerspace.org.au:7008) (`http` only -- no `https` yet).
Creating or altering pages from outside the Space will require you to log in. This is to prevent malicious damage. [Ask a Committee member](mailto:committee@hobarthackerspace.org.au?subject=Wiki%20access) for the password.

## Our Building
Our home is a shared space and a heritage building. Please respect these when using it.
The heritage issue means that we have to be careful how we look after the building, especially the older stone parts.

# This wiki
Our wiki runs on Wikmd software. It’s a file-based wiki that aims for simplicity. 
The documents are completely written in Markdown -- a markup language you're probably already 
familiar with (or can learn very quickly if you're not). 
Details on how to use it are in the [How to use this wiki](How to use the wiki) page. 

The base system is maintained by [Brian Marriott](mailto:brian.marriott@hobarthackerspace.org.au) -- 
but it's up to all members to provide the content! Just click the ![](/img/Wiki_New_button_sml-len6lxa3gbd62fhxfwpss3jk35ko.png) button above.
If you have suggestions for improvement, 
[email Brian](mailto:brian.marriott@hobarthackerspace.org.au) at the moment -- 
in future you'll be able to add them to a Github tickets page.

The source repository of the Wikmd software is at [github.com/Linbreux/wikmd](https://github.com/Linbreux/wikmd) and the documentation is at [linbreux.github.io/wikmd](https://linbreux.github.io/wikmd/).
