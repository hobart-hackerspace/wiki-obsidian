## The lab
*Well, it's actually just a workbench with equipment, but hey...*

The lab is in the **Tesla room**, co-located with the amateur radio station, a store of parts and all our networking equipment.

**Please keep the table tidy - it's small and rapidly runs out of space if someone leaves it covered in tools, components or half-built projects.**

## Electronics lab equipment
We have a bunch of nice gear, including a good digital oscilloscope, meters, varible power supplies, soldering, unsoldering and rework tools.
