# Migration sequence from `Wikmd` to `Obsidian Publish`

## Initial copy
1. Copy entire backup directory on to Brian's Mac
1. Entitle it `hhs-wikmd-capture-unchanged`
1. Duplicate that & call it `hhs-wiki-working-copy`
1. Within `hhs-wiki-working-copy`, delete the entire `.git` directory
	- We now have a clean slate from which to start a new `GitHub` repository
## `GitHub`
1. Before you can work with the `GitHub` repository you have to have relevant access and authentication set up.
	- A working `GitHub` account
	- Read-write access granted to the `hobart-hackerspace` `GitHub` repositories
		- If you don' have that, ask someone to set you up. Currently the owners are: Alistair, Tom, Leo, Brian, Trent & Shane
	- Authentication set up for your account so that you can push changes.
		- With command-line `push`es that's easiest if you provide a `ssh` key. [(GitHub doco tells you how)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication).
		- With a GUI tool, that tool should guide you.
## Base repository
1. Log into `GitHub` and create a new repository.
	- Call it `wiki-obsidian`
1. Make the `hhs-wiki-working-copy` directory a local `git` repository
	- `git init`
	- `git add *`
	- `git add */*`
	- `git add .*`
	- `git add .*/.*`
	- `git commit -m "Initial commit of all from WikMD except the git repository"`
	- `git branch -M wikmd`
2. We now have a branch against which we can compare future changes between the captured `wikmd` version and the live version, by re-importing all files and `git diff`-ing.
3. At this point we can push it up to `GitHub`
	- `git remote add origin git@github.com:hobart-hackerspace/wiki-obsidian.git`
	- `git push -u origin wikmd`

## Working repository

There are three major phases from here:
- Getting things working in `Obsidian`
- The "low-hanging fruit" - changes that all or most of the files and directories will need
- Detailed editing - small changes to individual files to make them work in `Obsidian` and then when published

But first, create two new branches to work in. These will be our primary working branches as thing evolve.
We'll call them `published` and `draft`. We also replicate them to `GitHub`

``` bash
git branch published
git checkout published
git push --set-upstream origin published
git branch draft
git checkout draft
git push --set-upstream origin draft
```

Note that we end up with the `draft` branch checked out. That's where we'll do most of the work.

### Obsidian setup
This assumes that you've got Obsidian installed on a suitable device. It runs on Linux, MacOS & Win. While it also runs on Android & iOS, I'm not sure if they will run it in conjunction with `git` -- someone please tell me...

### Terminology
Obsidian's background is as a "Personal knowledge base" so its terminology is different from that of a content management system for websites. In particular:

- "**Vault**"
	- A vault is a a single knowledge base. 
	- In practice that is a single base directory (with subdirectories) of markdown files, attachment files (usually media) and other files used by Obsidian for configuration etc.
	- The name of the vault is always the name of the directory
	- An Obsidian vault is treated as an entity when it comes to publishing and replication. Searches, indexing, etc. work within the entirety of a vault. You may have as many vaults as you like for your own purposes; for Hackerspace we have one "wiki" vault.
- "**Note**"
	- A single Markdown file, which will produce a single web page in our Wiki.
	- When displaying or linking to a note, Obsidian does not show the "`.md`" file suffix. But it's still there and must be used in links.
- "**Links**"
	- Obsidian understands two different syntactical forms for links to other documents - "Markdown links" and "Wikilinks".
		- Markdown links are in the standard Markdown form - eg "`[A page](A%20page.md)`" where the displayed text is enclosed in square brackets and the link target is URL-encoded text enclosed in round brackets.
		- Wikilinks are simpler (but more constrained ) in form: "`[[A page]]`". No URL encoding is required and the file suffix is not given, but the displayed text will match the file name.
	- In order to publish as HTML, we need to use the standard Markdown link form.

#### First the `attachments` directory
Before turning our working directory into an Obsidian vault, it's worth making one structural change - the location of attachments is different in `Obsidian` from `WikMD`.

- Remove the empty `attachments` directory
- Change the name of the `img` directory to `attachments`
- Add that change to `git`, `commit` it and `push` to `GitHub`
```
git mv img attachments
git commit -m "changed `img` directory to `attachments` to fit with obsidian"
git push
```
- Please note that this process nearly doubles the (present) size of the repo (adds about 70MB), because `git` treats the `git rm` as a removal & recreation, without doing any deduplication. So we end up with two copies of each attached file in the `git` `objects` directory. We could have avoided this by changing directory names before the initial commit but then whenever we want to compare live to the saved replica we'd have to make the change again.

#### Now create the `Obsidian` vault
- Open `Obsidian`
- If you don't have any current vault open, it will present you with the "Vault management" page. If you have one open, click on the name of that vault in the bottom-left corner of the window and select `Manage vaults...`.
- Click on `Open folder as vault` and select your `hhs-wiki-working-copy` directory.

The HHS Wiki is now your current open vault.

#### Obsidian settings
Obsidian keeps the settings for each vault separate from other vaults, so you're able to have different settings for Wiki one from those you may have chosen for your own vault(s).

The settings that are useful for managing and publishing the HHS wiki that are different from the default settings are:
- Editor
	- Display
		- `Readable line length`: off 
		- `Strict line breaks`: on
	- Behaviour
		- `Indent using tabs`: on
- Files and attachments
	- `Default location for new notes`: "Vault folder"
	- `Default location for new attachments`: "In subfolder under current folder"

***I'm sure there's more yet. I need to do a full mapping from a default installation.***

#### Commit those settings
The above process will have created a subdirectory called `.obsidian` in your `hhs-wiki-working-copy` directory, containing various config-type files. If we commit that directory to our repository then it will share the settings across other folks' copies.

``` bash
git add .obsidian/*
git commit -m "created obsidian vault"
```


### Low-hanging fruit
#### Attachment links
- We changed the `img` directory to `attachments`. We have to adjust all attachment links to match.
- No doubt there's a simple `sed` script to do that, but I simply used a project-wide replace in my favourite IDE, replacing all occurrences of "`(/img/`" with "`(attachments/`". 
- The omission of the leading "`/`" is deliberate as the setting for new attachments is for local sub-folders.
- It reported 66 links in 19 files.
- So we commit that:
``` bash
git add *.md
git commit -m "Adjusted attachment links"
```
#### Line indentation character
- `WikMD` is agnostic as to whether lines are indented using tab characters or multiple spaces; `Obsidian` is less flexible. It either uses tabs or precisely 4 spaces.
- So our documents have ended up with a mix, wihich causes confused formatting when published.
- So a global change was made of:
	- all leading 4-space groups to tabs, then
	- tab followed by 4 spaces to 2 tabs
	- this was repeated until no more existed
- (Of course, I'm sure `sed` would do it, too:-)
