# Migration sequence from `Wikmd` to `Obsidian Publish`

1. Copy entire backup directory on to Brian's Mac
1. Entitle it `hhs-wikmd-capture-unchanged`
1. Duplicate that & call it `hhs-wikmd-capture-working-copy`
1. Within `hhs-wikmd-capture-working-copy`, delete the entire `.git` directory
	- We now have a clean slate from which to start a new `GitHub` repository
1. Log into `GitHub` and create a new repository.
	- Call it `wiki-obsidian`
