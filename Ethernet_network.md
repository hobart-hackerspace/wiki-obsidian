# Ethernet connection points
## Building original wiring
Socket numbers in comms cabinet match the labelling of wall sockets. They all terminate in the white blocks on the outer wall.

| Socket # | Jupiter port | Used for                                                     | Location                                                       |

## Other comms cabinet sockets
There are other sockets in comms cabinet that aren't part of the building wiring as we inherited it. There are extra sockets on the white block that's part of the original wiring and there's a second black block above that.

|    Socket #     | Jupiter port  | Used for                 | Location |
| :-------------: | :-----------: | ------------------------ | -------- |
| **White block** |               |                          |          |
|        9        |               | not in use               | Unknown  |
|       10        |               | not in use               | Unknown  |
| **Black block** | (un-numbered) |                          |          |
|      left       |               | In use, unknown what for | Unknown  |
|      right      |               | In use, unknown what for | Unknown  |
|                 |               |                          |          |


## Direct cable connections to Jupiter switch
Some ethernet cables just come down out of the top of the cabinet and terminate directly on to the Jupiter box.

| Jupiter port | Cable colour | Used for           | Location          |
| :----------: | ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- |
|      16      | Green        | Hamilton Rm camera | NE corner of room |

|              |              |                    |                   |
