Our I2R CNC machine is an I2R A Series CNC A23 machine with a 610mm x 915mm working area,
mounted on a manufacturer-supplied heavy duty stand.

**Note -- This machine may only be  used by trained and approved operators.**  
This is because its too easy to break things, including the machine, if you make a mistake.
If you have a G code file that you've tested on a simulator and that you'd like to run, please consult a committee member (yellow badge).

## Rules for use
[CNC Usage Rules](CNC_Usage.md)

## Software
### Control software
The machine requires the `UCCNC` control software -- this is installed on the PC that's set up next to the machine. 

### Design software
`UCCNC` will read standard G-code files. These can be produced by most CAD/CAM packages and imported to the control PC won a USB stick or over the network using file transfer software such as *Magic Wormhole* (`wormhole send` and `wormhole receive`).

## Documentation
Full machine documentation is provided [on the manufacturer's website](https://i2rcnc.com/pages/help-center), and some specific documents are listed below.

### Supplied manuals

The machine came with an excellent set of manuals - it's recommended that prospective users read through all before starting.
Note that, as noted above, the machine requires the UCCNC software to drive it, but that software can take G-Code files from any appropriate 2D or 2.5D CAD design program. The manufacturer supports use of the machine with the Vectric software in [Section 5](attachments/I2R_manual_Sec_5.pdf) -- even if you're using other design software it's still worth reading that section as it has some useful pointers.
