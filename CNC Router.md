### CAD/CAM design
(something here)

### Using G-code simulators to verify your design
Every job should be tested with a simulator before running for real. 
This verifies that things will work as you plan and, in particular, stay within the bounds of your job.
The ability to practice and refine CNC programming without the need for a physical machine saves time, reduces costs, and minimizes risks. 

#### Some free simulators are:
- Online
	- [NC Viewer](https://ncviewer.com)
	- [Filipe Caixeta's "CNC Web Simulator"](https://filipecaixeta.github.io/cncwebsim/)
	- [Penta Simulator](https://sim.pentamachine.com)
- Offlline (installed on your machine)
	- [CAMOtics](https://camotics.org) -- Runs on Windows, MacOS & Linux

#### Commercial products
- [G-Wizard Editor](https://www.cnccookbook.com/g-code-simulator-viewer-generator-gwizard/) -- Windows & MacOS
- [CNC Simulator Pro](https://cncsimulator.com/) -- Windows only
