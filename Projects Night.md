Find it hard to achieve anything on a Thursday but don't like working alone? 

Need some accountability to help you move your projects along?
 
## Hobart Hackerspace Projects Night happens every Tuesday
 
## Simple Rules:
1. Members Only:
This is full members who have their own 24/7 access tag. No visitors, No guests, No hordes of marauding teens.
 
2. Project Focus:
You must be working on a project or learning outcome to participate. This isn't another social night.
 
3. Accountability Stickers:
To keep things on track, you'll be asked to write down what you're working on, or any outcomes you want to achieve and wear this with pride (or possibly shame) so that others can see what you're there to do.
 
4. Help is Welcome:
Although it's not a social gathering, we understand that sometimes you might need a little assistance. If you're asking others for help, please remember that they are there to work on their own projects.

If you're going to need a LOT of assistance, arrange this help in advance so that you're not interrupting someone unexpectedly.
 
 
**Pull out those projects and half finished widgets and stop procrastinating!**
